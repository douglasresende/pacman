## ACSII Pacman Challenge

Pacman finds himself in a grid filled with monsters. 
Will he be able to eat all the dots on the board before the monsters eat him?

Incomplete list of things the game needs:

 * pacman is on a grid filled with dots
 * pacman has a direction
 * pacman moves on each tick
 * user can rotate pacman
 * pacman eats dots
 * pacman wraps around 
 * pacman stops on wall
 * pacman will not rotate into a wall
 * game score (levels completed, number of dots eaten in this level)
 * monsters...
 * levels
 * animate pacman eating (mouth opens and closes)

## Questions.

1. How do we represent the grid?
2. How do we indicate where pacman is?
3. How do we indicate where dots are?
4. How does pacman eat dots.
